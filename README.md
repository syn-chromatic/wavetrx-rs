## `⌽` WaveTrx

### `➢` Introduction
WaveTrx is an educational project focused on the concept of data transmission through sound waves.

This method involves converting data into audio tones which can then be decoded back into digital information at the receiver's end by special markers that's defined by the protocol.

WaveTrx has a customizable protocol that defines the frequencies and markers used for transmission and reception, allowing flexibility in defining the bandwidth and ability to use ultrasonic frequencies.

### `➢` Tx/Rx Example
In this example, the receiver part is constantly listening to the audio, and the transmitter takes a string and converts it into audio tones through my protocol.

I am playing white noise on top that is heard by the receiver for the purpose of demonstration.
