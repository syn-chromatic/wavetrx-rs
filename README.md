## `⌽` WaveTrx

### `➢` Introduction
WaveTrx is an educational project focused on the concept of data transmission through sound waves. This method involves converting data into audio tones which can then be decoded back into digital information at the receiver's end by special markers that's defined by the protocol.

WaveTrx has a customizable protocol that defines the frequencies and markers used for transmission and reception, allowing flexibility for ultrasonic frequencies.
